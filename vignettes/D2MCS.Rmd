# Introduction

<div style = "text-align: justify">

*D2MCS* is an object-oriented framework able to identify and exploit the intrinsic characteristic of input data to (i) accurately distribute features in groups (feature clustering) and (ii) design and deploy effective MCS models. Below are included code snippets belonging to the different stages of *D2MCS* framework: (i) Data Manipulation, (ii) Feature Clustering, (iii) MCS Creation and (iv) Classification Results.

Furthermore, the package provides the facility to read the descriptions and details of all functions through the *help(D2MCS)* command. 

</div>

## Stage 1: Data Manipulation

<div style="text-align:justify">

The first step starts using the *DatasetLoader* class to convert the data to be analyzed into the structure compatible with *D2MCS* called *Dataset* (or *HDDataset* in case the dataset cannot be stored in memory). The following code fragment shows the parameters included in the *load* function after instantiating the *DatasetLoader* class.


```{R, echo = TRUE, results = "hide", eval = FALSE}
data.loader <- DatasetLoader$new()
data <- data.loader$load(filepath, header = TRUE, sep = ",", 
                         skip.lines = 0, normalize.names = FALSE, 
                         ignore.columns = NULL)
```

Once the loading process is completed and the dataset is available in a *Dataset* object, it is possible to perform different methods divided into three main categories taking into account their behaviour: (i) dataset information obtainer, (ii) dataset column removal and (iii) dataset splitting operation. The following code snippet shows some of the different functions in each category.

```{R, echo = TRUE, results = "hide", eval = FALSE}
## DATASET INFORMATION OBTAINER
data$getNcol()
data$getNrow()
data$getColumnNames()
data$getDataset()

## DATASET COLUMN REMOVAL
data$cleanData(columns = NULL, 
               remove.funcs = NULL, 
               remove.na = FALSE, 
               remove.const = FALSE)

## DATASET HANDLING AND SPLITTING
data$createPartitions(num.folds = NULL, 
                      percent.folds = NULL,
                      class.balance = NULL)
subset <- data$createSubset(num.folds = NULL, 
                            column.id = NULL,
                            opts = list(remove.na = TRUE, 
                                        remove.const = FALSE),
                            class.index = NULL, 
                            positive.class = NULL)
train <- data$createTrain(num.folds = NULL, 
                          class.index, 
                          positive.class, 
                          opts = list(remove.na = TRUE, 
                                      remove.const = FALSE))

```

Using the *createPartitions()* method, the dataset is divided in order to use the divisions to create the data structures required in the following phases, using the *createSubset()* and *createTrain() * methods. While the first method performs the creation of a *Subset* object used both for clustering operations and for validation purposes. On the other hand, the second method is responsible for creating a *Trainset* object necessary to perform the model training stage.

</div>

## Stage 2: Feature Clustering

<div style="text-align:justify">

After creating a Subset object, the stage two based on the distribution of features in clusters starts. The code snippet below exemplifies the three steps necessary to create and execute the clustering strategy called *DependencyBasedStrategy* included by default in *D2MCS*.

```{R, echo = TRUE, results = "hide", eval = FALSE}
## FEATURE-CLUSTERING ALGORITHM CREATION
conf <- DependencyBasedStrategyConfiguration$new() 
dbs <- DependencyBasedStrategy$new(subset, 
                                   heuristic, 
                                   configuration = conf)

## FEATURE-CLUSTERING ALGORITHM EXECUTION 
dbs$execute()

## FEATURE-CLUSTERING ALGORITHM FUNCTIONALITIES
dbs$getBestClusterDistribution()
dbs.train <- dbs$createTrain(subset, 
                             num.clusters = NULL, 
                             num.groups = NULL, 
                             include.unclustered = FALSE)

```

</div>

## Stage 3: MCS Creation

<div style="text-align:justify">

From the previous execution of the selected clustering strategy, a *Trainset* object is obtained to be used as input for the SMC creation phase. This stage is divided into three main steps (i) *D2MCS* framework initialization, (ii) MCS behaviour customization options and (iii) execution of MCS discovery operation.

```{R, echo = TRUE, results = "hide", eval = FALSE}
## D2MCS FRAMEWORK INITIALIZATION
d2mcs <- D2MCS$new(dir.path, 
                   num.cores = 2, 
                   socket.type = "PSOCK", 
                   outfile = NULL)

## MCS BEHAVIOUR CUSTOMIZATION OPTIONS
trFunction <- TwoClass$new(method, 
                           number, 
                           savePredictions, 
                           classProbs, 
                           allowParallel, 
                           verboseIter, 
                           seed = NULL)

## EXECUTION OF MCS DISCOVERY OPERATION
trained <- d2mcs$train(train.set, 
                       train.function, 
                       num.clusters = NULL, 
                       model.recipe = DefaultModelFit$new(), 
                       ex.classifiers = c(), 
                       ig.classifiers = c(), 
                       metrics = NULL, 
                       saveAllModels = FALSE)

```

Using the code fragment shown previously, the training of the ML models provided by the *caret* library is performed in order to find out which models offer the best performance for the dataset, taking into account the indicated parameters.

</div>

## Stage 4: Classification Results

<div style="text-align:justify">

After building the MCS, starts the next stage related to the classification of the data. To this end, the *D2MCS* tool needs to use the *TrainOutput* structure obtained by training the MCS, the dataset to be predicted and the voting schemes chosen to combine the results of the different MSC models. 

```{R, echo = TRUE, results = "hide", eval = FALSE}
## VOTING SCHEMES AVAILABLE IN THE CLASSIFICATION STAGE
voting.types <- c(SingleVoting$new(voting.schemes, 
                                   metrics),                                    
                  CombinedVoting$new(voting.schemes, 
                                     combined.metrics, 
                                     methodology, 
                                     metrics))

## EXECUTE THE CLASSIFICATION STAGE
predictions <- d2mcs$classify(train.output, 
                              subset, 
                              voting.types, 
                              positive.class = NULL)

## COMPUTE THE PERFORMANCE OF EACH VOTING SCHEME
predictions$getPerformances(test.set, 
                            measures, 
                            voting.names = NULL, 
                            metric.names = NULL, 
                            cutoff.values = NULL)

## OBTAIN THE PREDICTIONS OBTAINED OF EACH VOTING SCHEME USED
prediction$getPredictions(voting.names = NULL, 
                          metric.names = NULL, 
                          cutoff.values = NULL, 
                          type = NULL, 
                          target = NULL, 
                          filter = FALSE)

```

When the classification stage is completed, the tool produces a *ClassificationOutput* object to allow the user to obtain information about the classification performance (*getPerformances()* method) and to observe in depth the predictions obtained (*getPredictions()* method).

</div>


# d2mcs.Options

<div style = "text-align: justify">

The *d2mcs.Options* object is used to store the different configuration parameters of the MCS creation. It is important to keep in mind that if the parameters are not needed, the value can be omitted.

The option that exist initially and how its value is indicated to you are shown below. 
</div>
```R
# [verbose]
bdpar.Options$set("verbose", <<status_verbose>>)
```

Note that this feature is oriented to make it easier to extend and improve the future configuration of the package.

## Logging on D2MCS

<div style = "text-align: justify">
The *D2MCS* log is configured through the *configureLog* function. This system manages both the place to display the messages and the priority level of each message showing only the messages with a higher level than indicated in the threshold variable. The log can be output either by console, by file, or both.

```R
d2mcs.options$configureLog(console = TRUE, threshold = "INFO", file = "fileLog.log")
```

The type of message changes according to the level indicated:

<ul>
  <li> The **DEBUG**, **INFO** and **ERROR** levels return a text using the *message* function.</li>
  <li> The **WARN** level returns a text using the *warning* function.</li>
  <li> The **FATAL** level returns a text using the *stop* function.</li>
</ul>

If the case of wanting to deactivate the bdpar log completely, the *disableLog* method in *d2mcs.Options* object does this task. It is important to note that the messages with **WARN** or **FATAL** level will still be displayed by console.

```R
d2mcs.options$disableLog()
```

</div>
