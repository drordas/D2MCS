## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:
* Ensured no more than 2 cores are used in the examples, vignettes, etc. 
* Ensured that the functions of examples/vignettes/tests do not write in the user's home filespace.
## Test environments
* Ubuntu 20.04.2 LTS (on local and travis-ci), R 4.0.5
* local Windows 10 Pro, R 4.0.5
