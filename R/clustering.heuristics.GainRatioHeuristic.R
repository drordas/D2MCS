#
# D2MCS provides a novel framework to able to automatically develop and deploy
# an accurate Multiple Classifier System (MCS) based on the feature-clustering
# distribution achieved from an input dataset. D2MCS was developed focused on
# four main aspects: (i) the ability to determine an effective method to
# evaluate the independence of features, (ii) the identification of the optimal
# number of feature clusters, (iii) the training and tuning of ML models and
# (iv) the execution of voting schemes to combine the outputs of each classifier
# comprising the MCS.
