#
# D2MCS provides a novel framework to able to automatically develop and deploy
# an accurate Multiple Classifier System (MCS) based on the feature-clustering
# distribution achieved from an input dataset. D2MCS was developed focused on
# four main aspects: (i) the ability to determine an effective method to
# evaluate the independence of features, (ii) the identification of the optimal
# number of feature clusters, (iii) the training and tuning of ML models and
# (iv) the execution of voting schemes to combine the outputs of each classifier
# comprising the MCS.

#' @title Computes the Matthews correlation coefficient.
#'
#' @description The Matthews correlation coefficient is used in machine learning
#' as a measure of the quality of binary (two-class) classifications. It takes
#' into account true and false positives and negatives and is generally regarded
#' as a balanced measure which can be used even if the classes are of very
#' different sizes. The MCC is in essence a correlation coefficient between the
#' observed and predicted binary classifications; it returns a value between -1
#' and +1.
#'
#' @details \deqn{MCC = (TP × (TN - FP) × FN)/(\sqrt{(TP + FP) × (TP + FN) × (TN + FP) × (TN + FN)})}
